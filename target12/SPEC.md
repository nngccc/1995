# Target12 — Product Specification

## Overview

Recreation of a South African National Bisley shooting competition simulator (0.22" calibre), originally written in Turbo Pascal 7.0 by Nico Gerber (1996). The player aims a crosshair on a scorecard of 11 targets, fighting hand shake, breathing rhythm, and heartbeat to place accurate shots. This spec is intended to be complete enough to reimplement the game on any platform without consulting the source code.

## Origin

- **Original**: `TARGET12.PAS` — Turbo Pascal 7.0, BGI graphics, 640×480
- **Author**: Nico Gerber, Standard 9, 1996
- **Organization**: S.A.N.S.S.U. (Suid-Afrikaanse Nasionale Skietskyfskiet-Unie)
- **Competition**: National Bisley target shooting, 0.22" calibre rifles

## Language

All UI text is in English (translated from the Afrikaans original).

---

## Canvas and Coordinate System

- **Virtual resolution**: 640×480 pixels
- **Aspect ratio**: 4:3
- **Coordinate origin**: top-left corner (0, 0)
- **Y axis**: increases downward
- **Playfield boundaries**: top `BG=55`, bottom `OG=430`, left `LG=50`, right `RG=582`

### Display Scaling

The canvas is CSS-scaled to fit the viewport while preserving 4:3 aspect ratio. The internal 640×480 resolution never changes — all coordinates and sizes in this spec are in virtual canvas pixels.

Scaling logic:
1. Compare viewport aspect to 640/480
2. If viewport is wider than 4:3: `h = viewportHeight`, `w = h × (640/480)`
3. If viewport is taller than 4:3: `w = viewportWidth`, `h = w / (640/480)`
4. A `cssScale` factor (`w / 640`) is maintained for converting screen-space touch/mouse coordinates back to canvas coordinates

Fullscreen mode (toggled with F11) applies the same scaling at 100vw × 100vh with the canvas border removed.

## Game States

```
intro → shooting ⇄ help
                 ⇄ input_name / input_team / input_comp
       shooting → results ⇄ scorecard
                  results → shooting (restart)
                  results → intro (exit)
```

### 1. `intro` (Title Screen)

Black background, centered text:

| Element | Color | Font | Position (y) |
|---------|-------|------|-------------|
| "SOUTH AFRICAN" | `#0a0` | 22px serif | 75 |
| "NATIONAL" | `#ff0` | 24px serif | 110 |
| "BISLEY SHOOTING 1995" | `#a00` | bold 30px serif | 160 |
| "(0.22\" CALIBRE)" | `#00a` | 22px serif | 195 |
| "PROGRAMMING - NICO GERBER" | `#fff` | 14px sans-serif | 420 |
| "Press [6] for Help \| Press any key to start" | `#888` | 12px sans-serif | 450 |

All text is horizontally centered at x=320.

**Demo targets**: Three targets drawn at y=275, x positions 170, 320, 470.

**Demo shot animation** (timed from state entry):
| Time (ms) | Shot | Position |
|-----------|------|----------|
| 1500 | 1 | (340, 255) |
| 2500 | 2 | (320, 260) |
| 3500 | 3 | (320, 275) |

Each demo shot triggers a fire sound. Shot dots are `#a00`, 5px radius.

**Auto-advance**: At 5500ms, automatically transitions to `shooting`.

> **Note**: The displayed text suggests keyboard interaction ("Press [6] for Help | Press any key to start") but the current implementation only advances via the auto-advance timer. Keyboard input during intro has no effect (except F11 for fullscreen).

### 2. `shooting` (Main Game)

Scorecard displayed as background with all 11 targets. Crosshair overlaid, subject to drift, heartbeat, and breathing effects. Player aims and fires shots.

**Muzzle flash** on each shot: radial gradient centered on shot position, 60px radius:
- Stop 0.0: `rgba(255, 255, 255, α)`
- Stop 0.3: `rgba(255, 255, 100, α×0.7)`
- Stop 0.7: `rgba(255, 160, 0, α×0.3)`
- Stop 1.0: `rgba(255, 160, 0, 0)`

Plus a full-screen white overlay at `α×0.15`. Flash alpha starts at 1.0 and decays by `dt/100` per frame (fades over ~100ms).

**Round end** when either condition is met:
- 10 scoring shots fired (shots closest to a scoring target, not practice), OR
- 13 total shots fired

On round end → `results`.

### 3. `help` (Overlay)

Dark blue overlay `rgba(0, 0, 100, 0.95)` at rect (130, 80, 380×374).

Layout (all text left-aligned at x=145):

| y | Color | Font | Content |
|---|-------|------|---------|
| 105 | `#0a0` | 12px mono | "HELP - SA NATIONAL BISLEY SHOOTING .22" |
| 130 | `#ff0` | 12px mono | "KEYS" |
| 150–192 | `#ff0` | 12px mono | Arrow key controls (4 lines, 14px spacing) |
| 206–248 | `#ff0` | 12px mono | WASD controls (4 lines, 14px spacing) |
| 262 | `#ff0` | 12px mono | "SHOOT = [ENTER / SPACE]" |
| 276 | `#ff0` | 12px mono | "HOLD BREATH = [SHIFT]" |

| ~406 | `#888` | 11px mono | "Press any key to close" |

Any key → return to `shooting`.

### 4. `input_name` / `input_team` / `input_comp`

HTML overlay positioned absolute over the canvas, styled:
- Background: `rgba(0, 0, 80, 0.95)`
- Flex-centered vertically and horizontally
- Label: 18px serif, white, margin-bottom 16px
- Input field: 18px monospace, 240px wide, 8px/16px padding, background `#060`, border `2px solid #0a0` (focus: `#0f0`), white text, centered

Labels:
- Name: "ENTER YOUR NAME"
- Team: "ENTER YOUR TEAM"
- Competition: "ENTER THE COMPETITION"

Enter confirms and stores value, Escape cancels. Both return to `shooting`. Drift continues in background during input.

### 5. `results` (Score Screen)

Dark blue overlay `rgba(0, 0, 100, 0.95)` at rect (130, 80, 380×340). All text centered at x=320.

| 355 | `#a00` | 16px serif | "[5]   SHOOT AGAIN" |
| 380 | `#a00` | 16px serif | "[ESC] EXIT" |

Options: `[9]` → scorecard, `[5]` → restart, `[ESC]` → exit to intro.

### 6. `scorecard` (View Card)

Full scorecard rendered (same as shooting background). A countdown box is overlaid:
- Box: `rgba(0, 0, 100, 0.9)` rect at (290, 400, 60×35)
- Number: `#fff`, 22px serif, centered at (320, 425)
- Countdown: starts at 9, decrements every 1000ms
- When countdown reaches <0 → auto-return to `results`
- Any key → return to `results` early

### Shot Marks

- Color: `#a00` (dark red)
- Radius: 5px filled circles
- Drawn at each recorded shot position

---

## Crosshair / Sight

### Appearance

- Circle: 55px radius, white (`#fff`) stroke, 1px line width
- Four tick marks: 10px long, extending both inward and outward from the circle at cardinal points (left, right, top, bottom)
- Center dot: 2px radius, white filled circle

### Position Computation

The crosshair is drawn at:

```
sightX = cx + driftOx + breathDx
sightY = cy + driftOy + breathDy
```

Where:
- `(cx, cy)` = center point (player-controlled)
- `(driftOx, driftOy)` = hand shake drift offset (includes heartbeat pulse)
- `(breathDx, breathDy)` = breathing displacement

The shot lands at `(sightX, sightY)` when the player fires.

### Center Point Control

**Initial position**: (320, 220) — center of the practice target.

**Keyboard movement** (discrete, on keydown):

| Input | Δx | Δy |
|-------|----|----|
| Arrow Up | 0 | −10 |
| Arrow Down | 0 | +10 |
| Arrow Left | −10 | 0 |
| Arrow Right | +10 | 0 |
| W | 0 | −50 |
| S | 0 | +50 |
| A | −50 | 0 |
| D | +50 | 0 |

**Touch joystick** (continuous, per frame): see Touch Controls section.

**Boundary clamping**: After any movement, if `cx ≥ RG` then `cx = RG−1`, if `cx ≤ LG` then `cx = LG+1`, if `cy ≥ OG` then `cy = OG−1`, if `cy ≤ BG` then `cy = BG+1`. A boundary sound plays on clamp.

### Drift / Hand Shake

Simulates hand tremor. Drift is a velocity-driven offset from the center point that wanders randomly and springs back toward zero.

**Per-frame update** (every `requestAnimationFrame` tick):

1. **Random acceleration**: `driftVx += (random()−0.5) × 0.12`, same for `driftVy` (i.e., ±DRIFT_ACCEL where DRIFT_ACCEL=0.06, multiplied by 2)
2. **Spring force**: `driftVx −= driftOx × 0.005`, `driftVy −= driftOy × 0.005`
3. **Speed clamp**: max speed = `0.5 × (1 + breathStress × 2.0)` px/frame. If `|velocity| > max`, normalize to max
4. **Drag**: `driftVx × = 0.95`, `driftVy × = 0.95`
5. **Apply velocity**: `driftOx += driftVx`, `driftOy += driftVy + heartDy` (heartbeat added to Y only)

If the resulting sight position exceeds boundaries, drift offset is clamped and velocity is reflected (bounced).

### Heartbeat Pulse

Adds a vertical displacement to `driftOy` each frame, simulating pulse transmitted through prone chest-to-ground contact.

**Parameters**:
- Resting BPM: 60
- Amplitude: `HEART_AMPLITUDE = 3.5` px (modified by stress: `× (1 + breathStress × 0.8)`)

**Double-bump waveform** (beatPos = 0..1 within one heartbeat cycle):

```
if beatPos < 0.08:
    pulse = sin(beatPos / 0.08 × π)           // systolic bump
else if 0.15 ≤ beatPos < 0.22:
    pulse = 0.4 × sin((beatPos−0.15) / 0.07 × π)  // dicrotic notch
else:
    pulse = 0
```

Applied as: `heartDy = −pulse × heartAmplitude`

Heart period = `60000 / heartBPM` ms. Phase accumulates via `heartPhase += dt`.

### Breathing Rhythm

Dominant disturbance in prone position. 5-second cycle (12 breaths/min).

**Waveform function** `breathingWaveform(t)` where `t` = 0..1 within one breath cycle:

| Phase | t range | Displacement |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| Inhale | 0.0–0.4 | `e = (1 − cos(t/0.4 × π)) / 2`; dy = e × 25.0; dx = e × 4.0 |
| Natural pause | 0.4–0.5 | dy = 25.0; dx = 4.0 (full displacement held) |
| Exhale | 0.5–1.0 | `e = (1 − cos((t−0.5)/0.5 × π)) / 2`; dy = (1−e) × 25.0; dx = (1−e) × 4.0 |

Constants: `BREATH_PERIOD = 5000ms`, `BREATH_AMPLITUDE_Y = 25.0px`, `BREATH_AMPLITUDE_X = 4.0px`.

Inhale lowers the sight (+dy = down), exhale raises it back. The natural pause at t=0.4–0.5 is the ideal moment to hold breath and fire.

### Breath Hold

Activated by holding Shift (keyboard) or the breath-hold touch button.

**On press**:
1. Record `breathHoldPhase` = current position in breath cycle (0..1)
2. Capture current waveform displacement: `breathHoldStartDx`, `breathHoldStartDy`
3. Calculate **hold quality** = `1 − min(|breathHoldPhase − 0.45| / 0.45, 1)` — pressing near the natural pause (0.45) yields quality ≈ 1.0; pressing at the worst point yields ≈ 0
4. Calculate **rest target** (where crosshair settles to):
   - `breathHoldRestDx = breathHoldStartDx × 0.9`
   - `breathHoldRestDy = breathHoldStartDy × (0.7 + 0.3 × breathHoldQuality)`

**While held** — settle phase (first 500ms):
- `settleProgress = min(1, holdElapsed / 500)`
- Smoothstep easing: `eased = settleProgress² × (3 − 2 × settleProgress)`
- `breathDx = breathHoldStartDx + (breathHoldRestDx − breathHoldStartDx) × eased`
- `breathDy = breathHoldStartDy + (breathHoldRestDy − breathHoldStartDy) × eased`

**Over-holding** (past `BREATH_HOLD_MAX = 4000ms`):
- `breathStress = min(1, (holdElapsed − 4000) / 2000)` — ramps 0→1 over 2s
- Drift max speed multiplied by `(1 + breathStress × 2.0)` = up to ×3.0
- Heart amplitude multiplied by `(1 + breathStress × 0.8)` = up to ×1.8
- **Slow circular wobble** added to breathing displacement:
  - Frequency: `t × 2π × 2` Hz (where t = performance.now() / 1000)
  - `breathDx += sin(freq) × breathStress × 4.0`
  - `breathDy += cos(freq × 0.7) × breathStress × 4.0 × 1.2` (slightly elliptical)
- **Heart rate target** ramps up with delayed onset:
  - `hrStress = max(0, (breathStress − 0.25) / 0.75)` — no HR increase in first ~0.5s past limit
  - `heartBPMTarget = 60 + hrStress × 40` — up to 100 BPM

### Breath Release / Recovery

On releasing Shift (or lifting breath touch button):
1. `breathHolding = false`, `breathRecovering = true`
2. `heartBPMTarget` reset to 60

**Gasp phase** (first 400ms after release):
- `breathDy = 8 × sin(gaspT × π)` where `gaspT = elapsed / 400` — crosshair jumps down ~8px (involuntary inhale arc peaking at 200ms)
- `breathDx = 0`

**Exaggerated breathing** (400ms to 400ms + `BREATH_RECOVERY_TIME`):
- `BREATH_RECOVERY_TIME = 2000ms`
- `recProgress = min(1, (elapsed − 400) / 2000)` — 0 to 1 over 2s
- Amplitude multiplier: `1.5 − 0.5 × recProgress` (1.5× fading to 1×)
- `breathStress` fades: `breathStress × (1 − recProgress)`
- Normal waveform applied with amplitude multiplier
- When `recProgress ≥ 1`: recovery ends, `breathStress = 0`

### Heart Rate Chase

Heart rate (`heartBPM`) smoothly chases `heartBPMTarget` with asymmetric rates:

```
rate = 0.0004 if heartBPMTarget > heartBPM else 0.0002
heartBPM += (heartBPMTarget − heartBPM) × rate × dt
```

- **Ramp-up**: rate `0.0004` — takes ~5s to cover 80% of gap toward elevated target
- **Recovery**: rate `0.0002` — takes ~10s+, so elevated HR lingers after release
- During normal breathing (not holding), target is always 60 BPM

## Scoring

### Algorithm (ported from Pascal `SCORE` procedure)

For each of the 10 scoring targets (indices 0–4, 6–10):
1. Find the minimum distance from any fired shot to the target center
2. `distance = round(sqrt(dx² + dy²))` where dx, dy are absolute differences
3. Score based on distance bands:

| Distance (px) | Points |
|---------------|--------|
| 0–11 | 10 |
| 12–21 | 9 |
| 22–30 | 8 |
| 31–40 | 7 |
| 41–56 | 6 |
| >56 | 0 |

- Each target scores independently based on its closest shot
- Maximum total: 100 (10 targets × 10 points)
- Score recalculated after each shot

### Scoring vs Practice Shots

- A shot is "scoring" if its nearest target (by squared Euclidean distance) is any target except index 5 (practice)
- A shot is "practice" if its nearest target is the practice target at (320, 220)
- Round ends when 10 scoring shots are fired OR 13 total shots are used

| Arrow keys | Move center point | 10px |
| W/A/S/D | Move center point (large jump) | 50px |
| Enter / Space | Fire shot | — |

| 4 | Calculate & display score | — |
| 5 | Restart (clear all shots) | — |
| 6 | Show help overlay | — |
| Escape | Exit to intro screen | — |
| F11 | Toggle fullscreen | — |

### Keyboard — During Results

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| 9 | View scorecard (10s countdown) |
| 5 | Restart game |
| Escape | Exit to intro |

### Keyboard — Other States

- **Intro**: auto-advances after 5500ms (no keyboard interaction)
- **Help / Scorecard**: any key returns to previous state
- **Input overlays**: Enter confirms, Escape cancels
- **F11**: toggles fullscreen from any state

### Touch Controls

Displayed only on coarse-pointer (touch) devices, only during `shooting` state. Controls are **HTML overlay `<div>` elements** positioned in the viewport margins (the black bars left and right of the 4:3 canvas), not drawn on the canvas.

#### Layout

On landscape mobile screens wider than 4:3, the CSS-scaled canvas leaves horizontal margins. Touch controls live in these margins as children of `#game-container`, siblings of the canvas:

- **Left margin**: joystick activation zone
- **Right margin**: fire button (lower) and breath-hold button (upper)

`updateCanvasScale()` computes margin widths and positions the control elements accordingly. When margin < 80px (narrow viewport), `#game-container` gets a `.narrow-margins` class — controls overlay the canvas edges with semi-transparency instead.

#### Visibility

Controls are hidden via CSS (`display: none`) when not in `shooting` state. JavaScript toggles the `.touch-active` class on each control's container based on game state.

#### Joystick (left margin)

- **Activation zone**: entire left margin `<div>` (touch-action: none)
- **Idle hint**: centered in left margin at ~65% viewport height; dashed circle, radius 46px, white α=0.12; "MOVE" label 10px monospace
- **Active**: base appears at touch-down point within the margin; outer ring — white stroke, 2px, α=0.35; thumb nub — 16px radius, white fill, α=0.60
- **Radius**: `JOYSTICK_RADIUS = 60px` (screen pixels)
- **Movement**: per frame, `cx += (joystickDx / JOYSTICK_RADIUS) × JOYSTICK_MAX_SPEED`, same for cy. `JOYSTICK_MAX_SPEED = 3` px/frame at full deflection. Boundary clamping and sound applied same as keyboard.

#### Fire Button (right margin, lower)

- **Position**: centered horizontally in right margin, at ~75% viewport height
- **Radius**: 52px (screen pixels)
- **Idle**: fill `#a00` α=0.40, stroke `#fff` 2px α=0.55, label "FIRE" white bold 13px mono α=0.85
- **Pressed**: fill `#f55` α=0.75, stroke `#fff` 2px α=0.90, label α=1.0
- **Behavior**: fires a shot on touch-start (same logic as Enter/Space)

#### Breath-Hold Button (right margin, upper)

- **Position**: centered horizontally in right margin, at ~45% viewport height
- **Radius**: 44px (screen pixels)
- **Idle**: fill `#060` α=0.40, stroke `#0f0` 2px α=0.55, label "HOLD / BREATH" white bold 11px mono α=0.85 (two lines: "HOLD" and "BREATH")
- **Pressed**: fill `#0f0` α=0.75, stroke `#0f0` 2px α=0.90, label α=1.0
- **Behavior**: activates breath hold on touch-start, releases on touch-end/cancel (same logic as Shift key)

#### Multi-touch

Separate DOM elements with independent touch event listeners — no manual touch ID tracking needed. The player can simultaneously aim with the joystick, hold breath, and fire.

#### Narrow Viewport Fallback

When margin width < 80px, controls overlay the canvas edges with semi-transparency (α=0.5 background on control containers). This ensures controls remain usable on devices where margins are too narrow.

## Sound Effects

All procedurally generated via `AudioContext` oscillators and buffers (no audio files).

| Event | Sound |
|-------|-------|
| Fire shot | Layer 1 — **Crack**: white noise burst (80ms, gain 0.4 → exponential decay to 0.001). Layer 2 — **Boom**: sine oscillator sweeping 150→50 Hz over 200ms (gain 0.3 → 0.001 exponential). |
| Boundary hit | 200 Hz sine, 50ms, gain 0.15 |
| Bump/tick | 50 Hz sine, 30ms, gain 0.15 |

## Visual Style

### Colors

| Element | Color |
|---------|-------|
| Background | `#000` |
| Target fill | `#808000` (olive) |
| Target rings | `#000` |
| Crosshair | `#fff` |
| Shot marks | `#a00` (dark red, 5px radius) |
| Score text | `#0a0` (green) |
| Highlight text | `#ff0` (yellow) |
| User data | `#00a` (dark blue) |
| Overlays | `rgba(0, 0, 100, 0.95)` |

### Typography

| Usage | Font |
|-------|------|
| UI elements, labels, code-like text | monospace |
| Titles, headings, scorecard headings | serif |
| Credits, prompts | sans-serif |

## Player Data

| Field | Max Length | Input Key | Label |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Name | 15 chars | 1 | "NAME" |
| Team | 6 chars | 2 | "TEAM" |
| Competition | 11 chars | 3 | "COMP" |

Displayed on scorecard bottom section. Persists across restarts within the same session (not cleared by `resetGame`).

## Reset Behavior

On restart (`[5]` during shooting or results):
- Shot count reset to 1, score to 0
- Center point returns to (320, 220)
- All drift/velocity zeroed
- All breathing state reset (phase, hold, recovery, stress)
- Heart rate reset to 60 BPM
- Flash cleared
- Player data (name/team/competition) preserved

## App Icon

The app icon represents the game's core gameplay: a crosshair sight on a target.

### Design

- **Background**: dark (`#1a1a1a`) circle
- **Target ring**: olive (`#808000`) circle, ~60% of icon width
- **Crosshair**: white (`#fff`) — circle with 4 cardinal tick marks + center dot (matching the in-game sight)
- **Shot mark**: small dark red (`#a00`) dot, offset slightly from center (signature gameplay element)

### Usage

- **Android**: adaptive icon (vector drawable foreground/background layers) referenced via `android:icon` in AndroidManifest
- **Web**: inline SVG favicon via `<link rel="icon">` in the HTML `<head>`

## Known Differences from Pascal Original

1. **No CGA/EGA monitor selection** — fixed modern color palette
2. **Crosshair rendering** — drawn procedurally each frame instead of GETIMAGE/PUTIMAGE sprite
3. **Non-blocking architecture** — state machine with `requestAnimationFrame` replaces Pascal's blocking READKEY/DELAY loops
4. **Heartbeat effect** — new feature not in original; adds realistic sight pulse at 60 BPM
5. **ECG chart** — new feature; visual heartbeat timing aid
6. **Smooth drift** — velocity-based with spring return, replacing discrete ±5px jumps
7. **Center point / drift separation** — keys move center, drift wanders around it (original moved position directly)
8. **Round completion** — ends at 10 scoring shots OR 13 total (original: always 13)
9. **Live score** — updates after each shot (original: only on request or round end)
10. **Space bar** — added as alternate fire key alongside Enter
11. **Gunshot sound** — procedural crack+boom synthesis replacing simple oscillator tones
12. **Muzzle flash** — visual flash effect on firing (not in original)
13. **Fullscreen mode** — F11 toggle with aspect-ratio-preserving scaling
14. **Breathing rhythm** — respiratory sway cycle with hold-breath mechanic (Shift key)
15. **Touch controls** — joystick, fire button, and breath-hold button for mobile devices

## Future Considerations

- Drawrose splash screen ("LCC PRODUKSIES" with decorative rose graphic, typewriter effect — present in original Pascal, not yet implemented)
- Difficulty levels (adjust drift intensity, heartbeat amplitude, BPM)
- High score persistence (localStorage)
- Multiplayer / score comparison
- Wind effect simulation
- Print scorecard
